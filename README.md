# ML-portfolio-project

This repository contains the following parts of the machine learning pipeline:

- Data Cleaning**: Contains the `data_cleaning.py` script that loads and cleans the dataset.
- Model Building**: Contains the `model_building.py` script that builds and evaluates the model.
- Model Saving and Loading**: Contains the `model_io.py` script for saving and loading the model.
- FastAPI Endpoint**: Contains the `api.py` script for serving the model using FastAPI.
- Gradio/Streamlit UI**: Contains the `app.py` script for the Gradio/Streamlit interface.

## Instructions

1. To clean the data, run the `data_cleaning.py` script.
2. To build and evaluate the model, run the `model_building.py` script.
3. To save and load the model, use the `model_io.py` script.
4. To deploy the FastAPI application, run `api.py`.
5. To launch the Gradio/Streamlit UI, run `app.py`.
